# Noisy Nodes
Adds various noise-generation nodes to Unity Shader Graph.

* Perlin noise 2D
* Perlin noise 2D periodic
* Perlin noise 3D
* Periodic noise 3D periodic
* Simplex noise 2D
* Simplex noise 2D gradient
* Simplex noise 3D
* Simplex noise 3D gradient

All of the fancy parts of this library come from [Noise Shader](https://github.com/keijiro/NoiseShader) by  keijiro. I just made shader graph nodes to call the functions.

Please note: I am very stupid, and I do not understand mathematical noise. It is likely that several nodes and node parameters have names which do not accurately reflect their function.
